This Discord chatbot project was originally a collaborative effort between sz_skill and myself. 
Development was discontinued midway due to personal circumstances. 
Upon revisiting Discord after a year-long hiatus, we found that the platform and its API had evolved significantly, rendering much of the original code outdated. 
As a result, this project has been officially discontinued.

Despite this, the codebase serves as a helpful reference for beginners interested in Discord bot development. 
You are welcome to explore and repurpose the code for your own projects. 
Please note that the code may not run as-is and will require some effort to piece together and update for current compatibility.


Instructions for use
Please note: this is an incomplete and outdated project. Some portions of the code may require updating to comply with the latest version of the Discord API and related libraries.
If you still wish to explore or repurpose the code:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies
Review the main.py or entry point script to understand the project structure.
Update deprecated methods or API calls using the latest Discord.py documentation (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
Test components individually before integrating.
